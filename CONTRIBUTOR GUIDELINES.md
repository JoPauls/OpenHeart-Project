## What we're working on

This is a good place to link your Roadmap, GitHub Milestones, or Projects so newcomers can see what you're working on.

> Take a look at the issues in our [current milestone](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozfest-repo-template/milestone/1) or browse some [good first bugs](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozfest-repo-template/labels/good%20first%20bug) to get started!

Take a look at this [Roadmapping exercise](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/roadmapping/) to start making your own milestones and issues. This will help newcomers (& MozFest attendees!) know where they can help.

## How to submit changes

Explain how you want contributors to propose changes. For an example GitHub workflow, see Node.js's [instructions for code contributions](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-contributions).

> Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!
 
> 1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.
> 2. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine. Once you're happy with your changes...
> 3. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.

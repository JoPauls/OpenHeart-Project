## What we're working on

This is a good place to link your Roadmap, GitHub Milestones, or Projects so newcomers can see what you're working on.

> Take a look at the issues in our [current milestone](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozfest-repo-template/milestone/1) or browse some [good first bugs](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozfest-repo-template/labels/good%20first%20bug) to get started!

Take a look at this [Roadmapping exercise](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/roadmapping/) to start making your own milestones and issues. This will help newcomers (& MozFest attendees!) know where they can help.

## How to contribute?

The OpenHeart Project is just starting out and we are still in the planning stages on how we can actually achieve our aim of creating an open-source platform to facilitate open-science in the field of mechanical circulatory support.
Thus there is no code to improve or bugs to find and fix at this stage.
It is more a brainstorming session to collate ideas on how best to implement each individual feature and link it together into one platform.

An [Issue](https://github.com/JoPauls/OpenHeart-Project/issues) was created for each individual feature. 
Please comment on the individual issue with your ideas and tips or feel free to add your own ideas on what might be a helpful feature for an open-source research platform.

If you are contributing to open source for the first time (like us), check out this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
We did :)

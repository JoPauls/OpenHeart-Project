# Participation Guidelines

This project, participating in the Mozilla Festival, respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers, vendors, and anyone else involved in making the MozFest possible.

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity

The Mozilla Project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

Mozilla-based activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

## Raising Issues at #mozsprint

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices at #mozsprint which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact Zannah Marsh.

#mozsprint organisers reserve the right to refuse admission to anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the event.

## Working in the Open

Because working open is one of our core values, #mozsprint program planning is done in the open on Github (check out our repo [here](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint)). We hope participants will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration during the Festival, and will continue to work with an open ethos in their projects after #mozsprint. Learn more about [how we work open at Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Working_open).

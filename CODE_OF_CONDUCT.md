# Participation Guidelines

This project, participating in the Mozilla Global Sprint 2017, respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, contributors, and anyone else involved in making the OpenHeart Project possible.

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity

The OpenHeart Project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

Mozilla-based activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

## Raising Issues at the OpenHeart Project

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices at the OpenHeart Project which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact Jo Pauls.

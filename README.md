# Welcome!
Thank you for visiting the OpenHeart Project repository on GitHub.

This document (the README.md file) will give you some information about the project.

* [Background](#Background)

## Background
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are attributed as the leading cause of death throughout the developed world, accounting for 29% of all deaths in Australia in 2014 [(Roth et al. 2015)](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/132/17/1667). CVD often leads to heart failure (HF) and evidance from current literature suggests that HF is the fastest growing CVD globally. The gold standard treatment of end-stage heart failure (HF) is heart transplantation; however in 2013 only 4500 transplantations were performed worldwide [(Lund et al. 2015)](http://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(15)01378-9/abstract), thus the use of mechanical circulatory support through ventricular assist devices (VADs) in the management of acute and chronic HF is rapidly and continuously expanding [(Kirklin et al. 2015)](http://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(15)01450-3/abstract). Current devices cost upwards of $100,000, making this technology unaffordable in low- and middle-income countries. An estimated 37.7 million people are living with HF globally and approximately 80% of the global burden occurs in middle- and low-income countries. Fatality rates of HF patients are estimated to be 2.61 and 3.72 higher in middle- and low-income countries respectively when compared to high-income countries [(Yusuf et al. 2016)](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1311890). There is a clear need for improved cardiovascular support for HF patients in the developing world.


# Aims and Objectives

The OpenHeart Project is an open-source project aimed at fostering international collaboration between PhD students and researchers in the field of mechanical circulatory support to improve and develop mechanical assist devices for treatment of heart failure patients in these developing countries where treatment options are currently limited. Key objectives include:

*	Development and implementation of an open-source research platform to function as a collaboration tool and data repository for PhD students and researchers worldwide working in the field of mechanical circulatory support.
*	Development of a novel low-cost VAD for mechanical circulatory support of heart failure patients in low- and middle income countries.


# OpenHeart - Platform
Features of the OpenHeart platform will be:

*	OpenHeart Project website
*	Data Repository (incl. Version Control)
*	Discussion Forum
*	Mechanical Circulatory Support Wiki
*	Identity Verification (e.g. through Email and/or ORCID ID)

The OpenHeart Project website will be used to inform researchers and the general public about the background, aims and progress of the OpenHeart Project. The data repository will give PhD students and researchers worldwide the chance to upload and download their research data and experimental protocols. Through this data repository international collaboration can be facilitated in order to reduce research and development cost in the field of mechanical circulatory support, as this data will be freely available to all research groups for their work and experiments. The discussion forum will give the opportunity to raise research questions or propose collaborations / projects to the research community. A wiki website catered to mechanical circulatory support can be developed over time to define common terms used in the field, which would help to standardize definitions in the field and give PhD students and early careers researchers another point of reference.

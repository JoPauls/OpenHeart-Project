# How can you help?!?

Everyone, thank you for finding your way to the [OpenHeart Project](https://github.com/JoPauls/OpenHeart-Project)

The OpenHeart Project is an open-source project aimed at fostering international collaboration between PhD students and researchers in the field of mechanical circulatory support to improve and develop mechanical assist devices for treatment of heart failure patients in these developing countries where treatment options are currently limited.

To do this, we want to implement an open-source online platform with the following features:

*	OpenHeart Project website
*	Data Repository (incl. Version Control)
*	Discussion Forum
*	Mechanical Circulatory Support Wiki
*	Identity Verification (e.g. through Email and/or ORCID ID)

This documents is a set of guidelines for contributing to the project on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.


## How to contribute?

The OpenHeart Project is just starting out and we are still in the planning stages on how we can actually achieve our aim of creating an open-source platform to facilitate open-science in the field of mechanical circulatory support.
Thus there is no code to improve or bugs to find and fix at this stage.
It is more a brainstorming session to collate ideas on how best to implement each individual feature and link it together into one platform.

An [Issue](https://github.com/JoPauls/OpenHeart-Project/issues) was created for each individual feature. 
Please comment on the individual issue with your ideas and tips or feel free to add your own ideas on what might be a helpful feature for an open-source research platform.

If you are contributing to open source for the first time (like us), check out this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
We did :)

# How can you help?!?

Everyone, thank you for finding your way to the [OpenHeart Project](https://github.com/JoPauls/OpenHeart-Project)

The OpenHeart Project is an open-source research project which aims to improve research practices and outcomes within the field of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) to ultimately improve outcomes and quality of life for heart failure patients around the globe.

To do this, we implemented an open-source online platform with the following features:

*	[OpenHeart Project website](www.openheartproject.org)
*	[Data Repositories](https://openheartproject.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OR/overview)
*	[Mechanical Circulatory Support Wiki](https://openheartproject.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MCSW/overview)
* [Networking Capabilities](https://app.stride.com/f6705aea-cf6f-4343-b4ab-7932e017d5d2/lobby)

This documents is a set of guidelines for contributing to the project on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.


## How to contribute?

There are many ways for you to contribute, either within the MCS Wiki, by creating data repositories and sharing information, reviewing documenation or suggesting improvements.

[Issues](https://github.com/JoPauls/OpenHeart-Project/issues) were created to provide an overview of the areas you can contribute to. 
The OpenHeart Project is not actually implemented within Github, thus most issues will link to the OpenHeart entities within Stride, Confluence and Bitbucket and you will need to be a community member to be able to contribute within these entities.
If you are not a member yet, please visit our [website](www.openheartproject.org) and fill out the join form. An account will then be created for you.


## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to j.pauls@uq.edu.au.
